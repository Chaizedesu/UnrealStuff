#Blu-(sha)Der
BluDer is a dump (I guess you can call it library) for custom material expressions inside UE4. 
Language: HLSL (WORRY. IT WILL NOT BE CROSS COMPILED).

Warning: Some stuff may be outdated or already implemented.

# Hint table

WebGL
=====
vecN -> floatN
fract -> frac
F these *. / .* for floats seriously
