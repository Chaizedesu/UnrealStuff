# Materials

This may end up being a youtube series, so keep an eye on my channel.

Be smart , be creative, know your math.
Use cool functions (keep their graph in mind) with time as a parameter. Trigonometry and masks are your friends. Get along with
them and you have the basic building blocks ready for any weird material effect.

Refraction is the so called "next-gen" gaming VFX. It can be resource intensive and looks crap if you look through multiple
meshes with refraction applied. In that case you either try to replicate it with a custom distortion of yourself or try to
use just one mesh (animated) for your particle effects.

Check the sawtooth wave function (thanks Mr. Looman!) for example. It is a very simple and easy way to do a pulse. Plug it into a
circle making function and there you have a circle that grows over time and then reverts to normal. 

Some complex looking effects are actually very simple. You just need to hold up for a minute and analyze how each element of the final 
effect is made.

There are some algorithms that you need to know in order to master shader forgin in Unreal Engine, for example the outline toon shader.
Another good example is fresnel.
